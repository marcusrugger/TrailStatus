# Trail Status
My local mountain bike association doesn't have a good way of reporting and distributing trail conditions.  This project is an attempt at addressing that issue.

The main motiviation, though, is to use this as an opportunity to learn how to build a web service with C# and dotnet, whether or not it is ever used for the purpose stated above.
